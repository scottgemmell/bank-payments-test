# INSTRUCTIONS
I have my small app working on Mac and Windows via NPM or YARN.
Just run `npm install` or `yarn install` and visit `http://localhost:9000/` to get up and running.

# DESCRIPTION
I have added Redux Toolkit as I am a fan of Redux and some of its built-in technologies, notably immersion and reselect.
If I had more time I might have renamed some variables differently, created more dumb components and organised my files using barrel method a bit more, in order to combine imports. Ideally, I would have shown some of my UI skills with custom CSS and/or Styled Components.
